EAT-DA-BURGER APPLICATION

Welcome to the eat the burger application! This is a node Express app using mysql as a database and handlebars to serve as as styling. Althoug a simple one page application, the user still gets to interact.

The user will input whatever they would like to eat (burger). They will hit ('Burger me up!'), and their burger input will be populated onto the left side. Each burger rendered will have a button to signify it has been eaten ('Devour it'), and upon being clicked it will move the burger to the right, representing it has been eaten, where the user can then ('Clear Orders')
