EAT-DA-BURGER APPLICATION

Welcome to the eat the burger application! This is a node Express app using mysql as a database and handlebar to serve as the html.page. Just being one html page, the user still gets to interact with the application.

The user will input whatever they would like to eat (burger). They will hit submit, and it will be rendered their burger input onto the screen. Each burger rendered will have a  button to signify it has been eaten, and upon being clicked it will move the burger to the right, representing it has been eaten.
